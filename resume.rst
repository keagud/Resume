Della 
++++++
A personal orginizer similar to TaskWarrior, with the added feature of natural language processing to allow todos to be managed with a simple, naturalistic command syntax, e.g. "pick up Dave at the airport a week from this Wednesday." Tasks can be set to sync to a server for access from multiple devices. *Python*

Verba Whitakari
+++++++++++++++
A complete port of the classic Latin morphological analysis and dictionary tool `William Whitaker's Words <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whitaker%27s_Words>`__, translated and refactored from the original 1993 Ada program into modern C++. This project aims to maintain the functionality of the original in a form that can be better preserved into the future (Ada build systems are not trivial to work with in $CURRENT_YEAR) while improving performance and ease of use. *C++, Meson, Python*
