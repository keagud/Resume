 Linelog (Python, Git) https://github.com/keagud/linelog
 
  A development productivity tool that calculates the number of lines of code commited in Git by a given user, over a given interval of time, and displays the results as a curses-style graph on the command line broken down by language. Definitions for what should count as a "line" are fully customizable for each filetype.
